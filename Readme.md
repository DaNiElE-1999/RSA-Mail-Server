* ##### **Concept**

  ****RSA algorithm**** is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys: ****Public Key**** and ****Private Key.**** As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and the Private key is kept private.

  ****An example of asymmetric cryptography: ****


  1. A client (for example browser) sends its public key to the server and requests some data.
  2. The server encrypts the data using the clientâ€™s public key and sends the encrypted data.
  3. The client receives this data and decrypts it.

  The way I solved it is by using:

  * **Powershell**
    * To create a "backend" with Windows form, to emulate an e-mail sender UI.
    * When the "send e-mail" button is clicked, a check for the communication channel is performed:
      * This means that if the **sender** and the **reciever** have communicated before, they do not need to exchange the public keys.
      * If they have not, they need to create a communication channel.
    * To create a communication channel, before the email is even sent, both **end users** generate & send to each other their **public key**.
    * The public keys are exchanged by e-mail as requested in the assignment, and this can be seen on the MailHog UI.
    * The sender gets the public key from the reciever, and uses it to encrypt the message.
    * The sender then sends the encrypted message via e-mail. This can be seen on the mailhog UI, and on the text file in the "users/sender/mails directory".
    * The reciever gets the encrypted message, and decrypts it using his private key. This can be see on the Client's UI.
  * MailHog
    * To create a SMTP client for testing purpose, this technology was used.
    * I have used its API to transmit the encrypted e-mails and exchange the keys.
    * Its UI serves also for demostration of this assignment.
* ##### **How to run**

  NOTE: It is very important for the terminal to be opened in the correct path.

Run the SMTP server:

```
docker-compose up
```

Run the e-mail client for the sender:

```
cd powershell 
.\sendEmail.ps1
```

Run the e-mail client for the reciever:

```
cd users/<reciever>
.\readEmail.ps1
```
